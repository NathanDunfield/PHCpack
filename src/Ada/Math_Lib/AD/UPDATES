Tue 18 Dec 2018 : added a polynomial type to generic_monomial_vectors,
  which changed {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl}_monomial_vectors_io.
  This caused changes in generic_polynomial_vectors and ts_polvec.
  All generators for random instances, the random_monomials, the
  random_monomial_vectors, and random_polynomial_vectors were modified.
  Extended the evaluation and differentiation in generic_monomials
  and generic_monomial_vectors, tested by ts_monvec.adb.

Mon 17 Dec 2018 : added the straightforward evaluation functions to
  generic_monomials, generic_monomial_vectors, generic_polynomial_vectors,
  tested by ts_monom, ts_monvec, and ts_polvec.
  Modified generic_monomials.adb and generic_monomial_vectors.adb
  so the Eval() functions perform the multiplications in place.
  Added the straighforward differentiation and Speelpenning algorithm
  for a product of variables to generic_monomials, tested by ts_monom.adb.

Sun 16 Dec 2018 : moved the put procedures from ts_monom into separate i/o,
  into the packages {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl}_monomials_io.
  New package random_monomials with the code from ts_monom.adb.
  Defined vectors of monomials in generic_monomial_vectors and instantiated
  {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl}_monomial_vectors, with output in the
  corresponding _io packages, defined random_monomial_vectors, tested
  by ts_monvec.adb.  Defined the analogue polynomial_vectors packages.

Sat 15 Dec 2018 : new package generic_monomials, instantiated for double,
  double double and quad double complex coefficients, tested by ts_monom.
