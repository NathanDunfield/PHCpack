-- DESCRIPTION :
--   An 8-vector representation of a quad double complex vector consists
--   of 8 double vectors, with the highest, second highest, second lowest,
--   and lowest doubles of the real and imaginary parts.
--   A 2-vector representation of a quad double complex vector consists
--   of 2 double vectors, with real and imaginary parts stored in
--   sequences of four doubles, respectively the highest, second highest,
--   second lowest, and lowest double of each quad double number.
--   Convolutions run faster on the 2-vector representation.
