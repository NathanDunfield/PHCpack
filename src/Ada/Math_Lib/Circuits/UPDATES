Wed 18 Dec 2019 : ts_speelser computes all derivatives of a product,
  with convolutions for the coefficients of power series.
  New package generic_speelpenning_convolutions, instantiated with
  double, double double, and quad double coefficients in
  {standard,dobldobl,quaddobl}_speelpenning_convolutions.ads,
  tested by ts_speelser.

Tue 17 Dec 2019 : new test procedure ts_speelser, to develop the reverse mode
  of algorithmic differentiation on power series.
  Added the computation of the product to ts_speelser.adb.

Mon 22 Jun 2015 : new packages multprec_jacobian_evaluations and
  multprec_jacobian_circuits, tested by ts_gradcirc.

Sun 21 Jun 2015 : updates in standard_jacobian_evaluations and ts_speelsys.
  Upgraded standard_jacobian_circuits with EvalDiff procedure,
  tested by ts_gradcirc.  Versions for double doubles and quad doubles 
  in packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_jacobian_circuits, tested by ts_gradcirc.

Sat 20 Jun 2015 : new package standard_jacobian_circuits to contain the
  data structures to evaluate and differentiate systems of polynomials,
  tested by ts_gradcirc.

Fri 19 Jun 2015 : in standard_gradient_evaluations, added functions and
  procedures in case there are no common factors.
  New package standard_gradient_circuits encapsulates evaluation
  and differentiation, tested by ts_gradcirc.
  Extended {dobldobl,quaddobl,multprec}_gradient_evaluations also with
  routines for when there are no common factors.
  New packages {dobldobl,quaddobl,multprec}_gradient_circuits,
  tested by ts_gradcirc.

Thu 18 Jun 2015 : factored split_common_factors out of the different
  gradient_evaluations packages into coefficient_supported_polynomials,
  which also changed the *jacobian_evaluations.adb files.
  Provided an extended version of split_common_factors.

Wed 17 Jun 2015 : new directory populated with code from ../Functions.
