package Pipelined_Polyhedral_Drivers is

-- DESCRIPTION :
--   The procedures in this package define an interface to the
--   pipelined multitasked polyhedral path trackers,
--   in standard double, double double, and quad double precision.
--   The drivers are to be called in Drivers_for_MixedVol_Algorithm.
