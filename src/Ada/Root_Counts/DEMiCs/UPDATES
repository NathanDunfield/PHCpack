Fri 11 May 2018 : to simplex.cpp added writing of the cell indices to a
  string.  Added operations to DEMiCs_Output_Data to store the cell indices,
  after defining lists_of_strings.

Thu 10 May 2018 : new outputData.h and outputData.cpp,
  tested by ts_outputData.cpp to store lifting values.
  Updated use_outdata.adb.  Added conditional compilation statements
  to simplex.cpp, with updates in ts_demicsrun.adb to retrieve the
  lifting from the computed output of DEMiCs.

Wed 9 May 2018 : new use_outdata.ads and use_outdata.adb to export the
  operations of demics_output_data to C and C++.

Tue 8 May 2018 : new demicsrun.h, demicsrun.cpp, tested by ts_demicsrun.adb,
  to call demics directly from an Ada procedure.
  Removed superfluous semi-colons of the documentation of main.cpp.
  Added to the documentation of inputData.h and updated demicsrun.h
  and demicsrun.cpp so the mixed volume is computed.
  New packages demics_output_data to store the results of DEMiCs,
  tested by ts_outdata.adb.

Mon 7 May 2018 : documented the parameters of a function in main.cpp.
  Did some reformatting in inputData.h and removed extraneous parentheses
  in equality comparison on line 98 in inputData.cpp.
  Added program ts_inputData.cpp to test inputData, with added documentation
  in inputData.h and some modifications in inputData.cpp.

Sun 6 May 2018 : added the reformatted source code of DEMiCs.

Thu 3 May 2018 : fixed making of mixed cells in demics_output_convertors
  for semi- and un-mixed inputs.  Fixed testing of inner normal in
  demics_output_convertors for semi- and un-mixed inputs.
  Fixed bug in parsing of labels computed by demics for semi-mixed inputs,
  updated demics_command_line.adb.

Wed 2 May 2018 : updated demics_command_line and ts_calldemics.adb
  to deal with semi-mixed and unmixed inputs.  Updated ts_calldemics.adb
  and demics_output_convertors for semi- and un-mixed inputs.

Tue 24 Apr 2018 : new package demics_output_convertors with code factored
  out of ts_calldemics.  Added computation of the normal to each cell in
  demics_output_convertors.adb.  To demics_output_convertors,
  added a check on the computed labels, computed via the inner normal.

Mon 23 Apr 2018 : improved ts_calldemics, adding absolute path name as
  default argument to the caller procedure, started parsing lifting values.
  Fixed parsing of lifting.  New package demics_command_line, 
  with code taken out and tested by ts_calldemics.
  To ts_calldemics, added function to make the mixed cell configuration.
