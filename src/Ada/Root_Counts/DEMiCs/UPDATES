Mon 7 May 2018 : documented the parameters of a function in main.cpp.
  Did some reformatting in inputData.h and removed extraneous parentheses
  in equality comparison on line 98 in inputData.cpp.
  Added program ts_inputData.cpp to test inputData, with added documentation
  in inputData.h and some modifications in inputData.cpp.

Sun 6 May 2018 : added the reformatted source code of DEMiCs.

Thu 3 May 2018 : fixed making of mixed cells in demics_output_convertors
  for semi- and un-mixed inputs.  Fixed testing of inner normal in
  demics_output_convertors for semi- and un-mixed inputs.
  Fixed bug in parsing of labels computed by demics for semi-mixed inputs,
  updated demics_command_line.adb.

Wed 2 May 2018 : updated demics_command_line and ts_calldemics.adb
  to deal with semi-mixed and unmixed inputs.  Updated ts_calldemics.adb
  and demics_output_convertors for semi- and un-mixed inputs.

Tue 24 Apr 2018 : new package demics_output_convertors with code factored
  out of ts_calldemics.  Added computation of the normal to each cell in
  demics_output_convertors.adb.  To demics_output_convertors,
  added a check on the computed labels, computed via the inner normal.

Mon 23 Apr 2018 : improved ts_calldemics, adding absolute path name as
  default argument to the caller procedure, started parsing lifting values.
  Fixed parsing of lifting.  New package demics_command_line, 
  with code taken out and tested by ts_calldemics.
  To ts_calldemics, added function to make the mixed cell configuration.
