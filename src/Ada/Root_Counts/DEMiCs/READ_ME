Dynamic Enumeration of all Mixed Cells in PHCv2.4.54

This directory was added in version 2.4.53 to prepare the interface
to DEMiCs, software for the dynamic enumeration of all mixed cells.
This software was developed by Tomohiko Mizutani, Akiko Takeda,
and Masakazu Kojima and licensed under GNU GPL Version 2 or higher.

The current interface is a simple file based interface,
which assumes the executable is available as /tmp/demics
on UNIX like systems such as Mac OS X and Linux.

The original C++ code is included, after reformatting and removal of
many superfluous blank lines.  The README.txt is copied from the SRC
folder of the DEMiCs.0951 distribution archive.
This README.txt describes the definition of the input files and the
option to the executable demics.
