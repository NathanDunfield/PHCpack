Sun 10 Jul 2016 : ts_serpath contains a very simple path tracker.

Sat 9 Jul 2016 : new test procedure ts_serpath to develop the path tracking
  with power series.

Thu 7 Jul 2016 : replacing order by degree changed *newton_series*,
  ts_sernew, and series_and_predictors.  In series_and_predictors,
  renamed Least_Order() to Order().

Wed 6 Jul 2016 : extra functions in series_and_solutions to work directly
  with the coordinate vectors of solutions.  Refactored code from ts_serpred
  to series_and_predictors, for the first stage of the series predictor.
  Tested the setting of step size in ts_serpred, also for dd/qd.

Tue 5 Jul 2016 : bug fix in series_and_solutions.adb with the create
  in case idx = 0; this special case must have a separate loop.
  Made not verbose versions in power_series_methods.adb silent.
  New package series_and_predictors, tested by ts_serpred.
  Added setting of the step size to series_and_predictors.

Mon 4 Jul 2016 : added eval function to series_and_homotopies, tested
  by ts_serhom.  Added shift operations to series_and_homotopies,
  with added test in ts_serhom.  DoblDobl and QuadDobl versions of
  the functions and procedures are added to series_and_homotopies,
  with corresponding tests in ts_serhom.

Sun 3 Jul 2016 : new package series_and_homotopies, tested by ts_serhom.

Wed 29 Jun 2016 : new package series_and_solutions, tested by ts_sersol.
  Added tests in double double and quad double precision to ts_sersol.
  New package power_series_methods with code factored out of ts_sersol.
  Added mainseries to define the phc -u.

Tue 28 Jun 2016 : in _newton_series.adb, for QR_Newton, also write the
  result of the polynomial evaluation at the start.
  Applied set_order() to the polynomial systems and its Jacobian matrix
  in standard_newton_series.adb.

Mon 27 Jun 2016 : new packages {dobldobl,quaddobl}_newton_series for double
  double and quad double Newton on series, tested by ts_sernew.

Fri 24 Jun 2016 : added QR Newton to standard_newton_series,
  with added tests in ts_sernew.

Tue 21 Jun 2016 : updated standard_newton_series with many steps,
  tested by ts_sernew.

Mon 20 Jun 2016 : new packages standard_newton_series, tested by ts_sernew.

Wed 7 Oct 2015 : fixed call to silent root refiners in ts_extrapts for
  double double and quad double precisin.

Mon 21 Sep 2015 : extended black_box_univariate_solvers with routines in
  double double and quad double precision.

Thu 28 Aug 2013 : extended black_box_univariate_solvers with routines to
  solving univariate Laurent polynomials with multiprecision arithmetic.
  Exported more routines for the C to PHCpack interface.

Sat 30 Nov 2013 : updated black_box_univariate_solvers.a*,
  sample_plane_curves.a*, ts_extrapol.adb and ts_extrapts for multiprecision.

Fri 29 Nov 2013 : changed sample_plane_curves.adb and ts_extrapol.adb
  in search for a bug that turned out to be in the copy of lists in
  multprec_complex_solutions.adb.

Thu 28 Nov 2013 : higher-order predictors in multiprecision arithmetic
  in a new package multprec_extrapolators, and for testing purposes,
  updated sample_plane_curves, multprec_durand_kerner, ts_extrapol, and
  black_box_univariate_solvers.

Mon 10 Jun 2013 : all files in this directory changed because of the
  new types natural32 and integer32.

Tue 14 May 2013 : new directory with code from Root_Counts/Implift 
  and ../Trackers.  New package sample_plane_curves, with updates in
  ts_extrapol and a new ts_extrapts.
