Mon 5 Oct 2020 : added double_double_functions, extended random_vectors,
  to define in dbl2_norm_host the norm computation in double double precision,
  tested by test_dbl2_norm.cpp.

Fri 2 Oct 2020 : for both double and complex double, the constant
  d_shmemsize can be raised to 1024 and this constant is moved to the
  header file of {dbl,cmplx}_norm_kernels, so test_{dbl,cmplx}_norm_d.cpp
  may use this constant.  Updated makefile_windows for test_dbl_norm_d.
  Extended dbl_norm_kernels, {run,test}_dbl_norm_d with functions to
  compute the norm and to normalize with multiple thread blocks.
  Extended cmplx_norm_kernels, {run,test}_cmplx_norm_d similarly.

Thu 1 Oct 2020 : new test program test_norm_d.cpp without parameters to
  verify correctness and determine the best block size.
  In run_norm_d.cpp, enlarged the precision in the output.
  Fixed a bug in dbl_norm_host.cpp and dbl_norm_kernels.cpp.
  Moved code shared between run_norm_d and test_norm_d into
  random_vector.h and random_vectors.cpp, renamed run_norm_d into
  run_dbl_norm_d and test_norm_d into run_dbl_norm_d, for the complex
  analogues run_cmplx_norm_d and test_cmplx_norm_d, which rely on the
  new cmplx_norm_host and cmplx_norm_kernels.

Wed 2 Sep 2020 : figured out the makefile for windows, and made the
  files makefile_windows and makefile_unix, in addition to makefile
  to use for both (with the proper definition of MAKEFILE).
