  instead of double_double.  Added unary minus to double_double_functions
  and double_double_gpufun.  Updated makefile_unix.
  To triple_double_functions, added the increment of one double; new are:
  random3_vectors, dbl2_norm_host, triple_double_gpufun, dbl3_norm_kernels,
  tested by test_dbl3_norm; updated makefile, makefile_unix.
  Edited dbl2_norm_host and dbl2_norm_kernels.  Updated makefile_windows.
  In double_double_functions.cpp, replace "and" by "&&" in a test.
  Edited documentation of dbl3_norm_host.h and dbl3_norm_kernels.h.
  Added inc_d function to quad_double_functions, new quad_double_gpufun,
  random4_vectors, dbl4_norm_host, dbl4_norm_kernels, tested by 
  test_dbl4_norm; updated makefile and makefile_unix.

Mon 12 Oct 2020 : small edits in octo_double_functions.h.
  New quad_double_functions.h, quad_double_functions.cpp, tested by
  test_quad_doubles.cpp, updated makefile and makefile_unix.
  Added functions mul_pwr2, sqrt, and write_doubles 
  to {triple,quad,penta,octo,deca}_double_functions,
  tested by test_{triple,quad,penta,octo,deca}_doubles.cpp.

Sun 11 Oct 2020 : fixed documentation errors in triple_double_functions.h.
  New penta_double_functions.h, penta_double_functions.cpp, tested by
  test_penta_doubles.cpp, updated makefile and makefile_unix.
  New octo_double_functions.h, octo_double_functions.cpp, tested by
  test_octo_doubles.cpp, updated makefile and makefile_unix.
  New deca_double_functions.h, deca_double_functions.cpp, tested by
  test_deca_doubles.cpp, updated makefile and makefile_unix.
  Corrected documention errors in penta_double_functions.h.
  Updated makefile_windows for three new test programs.

Sat 10 Oct 2020 : new triple_double_functions.h, triple_double_functions.cpp,
  tested by test_triple_doubles.cpp.  Updated makefile and makefile_unix;
  and also makefile_windows.

Thu 8 Oct 2020 : small edits in dbl2_norm_kernels.h and dlb2_norm_kernels.cu.
  New cmplx2_norm_kernels.h and cmplx2_norm_kernels.cu with code to
  compute the 2-norm and normalize a vector of small size, with test
  code in test_cmplx2_norm.cpp.  Fixed bug in random2_vectors.cpp.
  Extended makefile_unix and makefile_windows.  Completed kernels for
  complex double double vectors in cmplx2_norm_kernels.* and tested the
  correctness in test_cmplx2_norm.cpp.  New run_cmplx2_norm.cpp, updated
  test_cmplx2_normc.cpp and the makefiles.

Wed 7 Oct 2020 : splitted the random_vectors into random_numbers,
  random_vectors, and random2_vectors, updated {run,test}_dbl2_norm.cpp,
  test_cmplx2_norm.cpp, and the makefile_unix.  Updated makefile_windows
  and adjusted random_numbers.cpp to random_numbers_windows.cpp.
  Patched random2_vectors.cpp so random real and imaginary parts
  will always be on the complex unit circle.

Tue 6 Oct 2020 : renaming of files run_dbl_norm_d.cpp -> run_dbl_norm.cpp,
  test_dbl_norm_d.cpp -> test_dbl_norm.cpp, run_cmplx_norm_d.cpp ->
  run_cmplx_norm.cpp, and test_cmplx_norm_d.cpp -> test_cmplx_norm.cpp.
  Updated the makefiles accordingly.  Included header file in
  double_double_gpufun.cu, minor update in dbl2_norm_host.cpp,
  fixed bug in test_dbl2_norm.cpp, and completed dbl2_norm_kernels.cu.
  In double_double_gpufun.cu, replaced 'and' by '&&' because of MS VC.
  Updated makefile_windows.  New run_dbl2_norm.cpp for manual tests
  on the 2-norm calculations in double double precision, with a new
  parse_run_arguments, for use in run_dbl_norm and run_cmplx_norm.
  Extended test_dbl2_norm.cpp with more tests to verify the correctness
  and a timing test.  Extended random_vectors with a function to generate
  a random complex double double vector, new cmplx2_norm_host and
  test_cmplx2_norm.cpp for 2-norms of complex double double vectors.

Mon 5 Oct 2020 : added double_double_functions, extended random_vectors,
  to define in dbl2_norm_host the norm computation in double double precision,
  tested by test_dbl2_norm.cpp.  In double_double_functions.h, changed
  prefix dd_ into ddf_, fixed bugs in double_double_functions.cpp, with
  the addition of some functions, tested by test_double_doubles.cpp;
  updated dbl2_norm_host.cpp.  Improved test_dbl2_norm.cpp.
  New double_double_gpufun.h, double_double_gpufun.cu, dbl2_norm_kernels.h,
  dbl2_norm_kernels.cu, with updated test_dbl2_norm.cpp, and adjusted
  makefile_unix.

Fri 2 Oct 2020 : for both double and complex double, the constant
  d_shmemsize can be raised to 1024 and this constant is moved to the
  header file of {dbl,cmplx}_norm_kernels, so test_{dbl,cmplx}_norm_d.cpp
  may use this constant.  Updated makefile_windows for test_dbl_norm_d.
  Extended dbl_norm_kernels, {run,test}_dbl_norm_d with functions to
  compute the norm and to normalize with multiple thread blocks.
  Extended cmplx_norm_kernels, {run,test}_cmplx_norm_d similarly.

Thu 1 Oct 2020 : new test program test_norm_d.cpp without parameters to
  verify correctness and determine the best block size.
  In run_norm_d.cpp, enlarged the precision in the output.
  Fixed a bug in dbl_norm_host.cpp and dbl_norm_kernels.cpp.
  Moved code shared between run_norm_d and test_norm_d into
  random_vector.h and random_vectors.cpp, renamed run_norm_d into
  run_dbl_norm_d and test_norm_d into run_dbl_norm_d, for the complex
  analogues run_cmplx_norm_d and test_cmplx_norm_d, which rely on the
  new cmplx_norm_host and cmplx_norm_kernels.

Wed 2 Sep 2020 : figured out the makefile for windows, and made the
  files makefile_windows and makefile_unix, in addition to makefile
  to use for both (with the proper definition of MAKEFILE).
