Thu 1 Oct 2020 : new test program test_norm_d.cpp without parameters to
  verify correctness and determine the best block size.
  In run_norm_d.cpp, enlarged the precision in the output.
  Updated makefile_windows.

Wed 2 Sep 2020 : figured out the makefile for windows, and made the
  files makefile_windows and makefile_unix, in addition to makefile
  to use for both (with the proper definition of MAKEFILE).
