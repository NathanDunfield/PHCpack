     Generates two instances of the same random double double vector,

     vlo_device, for double arrays of size at least equal to dim.

   ON ENTRY :
     dim      dimension of the random real vector.

   DESCRIPTION :
     Generates two instances of the same random complex vector,
     one for the host and another for the device.
     The complex vector is represented by four real vectors,
     with the high and low real parts and with high and low imaginary parts.
     The complex numbers are on the complex unit circle.

     Space has been allocated for all arrays of size at least dim.

   ON ENTRY :
     dim        dimension of the random complex vector.

   ON RETURN :
     vrehi_host   high real parts of the complex vectors;
     vrelo_host   low real parts of the complex vectors;
     vimhi_host   high imaginary parts of the complex vectors;
     vimlo_host   low imaginary parts of the complex vectors;
