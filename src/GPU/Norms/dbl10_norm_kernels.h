/*
  The constant da_shmemsize determines the size of the vectors
  stored in shared memory.  As every thread works on one entry
  in the shared memory vectors, for deca double precision,
  this size is bounded by the number of threads in a block.
  The largest dimension for which the small normalization runs
  is thus the value of da_shmemsize.
  The largest dimension for which the large normalization runs
  is the square of the value of da_shmemsize because the algorithm
  sums two arrays of squares, the squares of the real and the
  squares of the imaginary part, thus very similar to case of
  the small normalization.  For example, for da_shmemsize = 256,
  the largest dimension is thus 256*256 = 65536.
 */

/*
  The constant maxrounds determines the number of rounds
  in the normalization of medium sized vectors.
  The largest dimension for a medium size normalization
  is thus da_shemsize*maxrounds, for instance: 256*96 = 24576.
