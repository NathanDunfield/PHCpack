Tue 9 Oct 2018 : updated workspace_host.h with the rhs for mgs, simplified
  single line body loops in workspace_host.tpp and wrote an elementary
  test program in test_workspace.cpp.  Separated the classes in varset.h,
  making the files twoint.h, eqidxcoef.h, generalset.h, monidxset.h,
  monset.h and including monset.h in the header eval_host.h.
  Moved the seven class definitions out of eval_host.h and eval_host.tpp
  into seven different cpuinsthom* header and tpp files.
  The file eval_host.tpp no longer exists and eval_host.h just holds the
  #include statements for evaluation and differentiation of homotopies.
  The rhs in workspace_host.tpp must be allocated with one extra number.
  Added verbose parameter to the functions in newton_host,
  tested by test_newton.cpp.

Mon 8 Oct 2018 : copied the mgs* files for the modified Gram-Schmidt method
  from the Host folder.  Added a function to mgs_host.h and mgs_host.cpp
  to work with an allocated right hand side vector rhs and deallocate this
  vector also in the wrapper function.  Used templates in the test function
  of test_mgs.cpp, so the test program turns out to be much shorter.
  Copied parameter.h, parameter.cpp, and test_parameter.cpp from the Host
  folder with some minor additions to the documentation.
  The class PathStep is splitted off from the path_data files.
  The code in path_step.h, path_step.tpp, path_data.h, path_data.tpp
  is tested by test_pathdata.cpp.
