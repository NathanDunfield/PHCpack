Mon 8 Oct 2018 : copied the mgs* files for the modified Gram-Schmidt method
  from the Host folder.  Added a function to mgs_host.h and mgs_host.cpp
  to work with an allocated right hand side vector rhs and deallocate this
  vector also in the wrapper function.  Used templates in the test function
  of test_mgs.cpp, so the test program turns out to be much shorter.
