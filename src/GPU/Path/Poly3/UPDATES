Thu 4 Oct 2018 : updated polyeq.h, polyeq.tpp, and test_polyeq.cpp to
  test the evaluation and differentiation of general polynomials.

Wed 3 Oct 2018 : moved update_max_deg from polysys.tpp to polymon.tpp
  and documented this method.  Updated polyeq.h and polyeq.tpp, with
  a test on the evaluation in test_polyeq.cpp.
  Added test on computing the derivatives in test_polyeq.cpp.
  In test_polyeq.cpp, computed the maximum degrees of the monomials.

Tue 2 Oct 2018 : improved test_polymon.cpp with functions to generate a
  random monomial and to prompt the user for a monomial.
  Improved the documentation in polymon.h and the evaluation of higher
  degree monomials is tested in test_polymon.cpp.  Differentiation tested 
  in test_polymon.cpp and improved documentation in polymon.h.
  New files test_utils.h and test_utils.tpp with test utility functions
  for use in test_polymon.cpp and in test_polyeq.cpp.

Mon 1 Oct 2018 : moved code from polysys.tpp into polymon.tpp and polyeq.tpp,
  new test program test_polyeq.cpp, with updated makefile.
  Added calling of speel function to test_polymon.cpp.

Sun 30 Sep 2018 : improved documentation in polymon.h and better organization
  of the tests in test_polymon.cpp.

Sat 29 Sep 2018 : added better comments to polymon.h, tested the plain
  evaluation of monomials in test_polymon.cpp, fixed test_polysol.cpp.

Fri 28 Sep 2018 : new test program test_polymon.cpp, to test the data
  structure to store a monomial, with added comments in polymon.h.
