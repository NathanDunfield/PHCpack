Accelerated Convolutions for Power Series Multiplication in PHCv2.4.82.

The code in this folder concerns the product of two power series,
truncated to the same degree.

Input: d, degree of the series;
       x, array of range 0..d with coefficients of the first series;
       y, array of range 0..d with coefficients of the second series.

Output: z = x*y, array of range 0..d with coefficients of the product
        of x with y.
      
Algorithm: 1.  z(0) := x(0)*y(0)
           2.  for k in 1..d do
           2.1     z(k) := x(0)*y(k)
           2.2     for i in 1..k do
           2.2.1       z(k) := z(k) + x(i)*y(k-i)

The above algorithm is implemented for several multiple double precisions.

The data parallel version of the algorithm, with d+1 threads in a block,
reduces to two statements:

   1.   z(k) := x(0)*y(k)
   2.   for i in 1..k do
   2.1      z(k) := z(k) + x(i)*y(k-i)

where thread k computes z(k).
