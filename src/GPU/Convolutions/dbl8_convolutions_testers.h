 * DESCRIPTION :
 *   Runs five tests on convolutions in octo double precision.

 *   seed     seed of the random number generators,
 *            if 0, then the current time will be used as seed;
 *   deg      degree of all series;
 *   vrblvl   is the verbose level:
 *            if 0, then there is no output,
 *            if 1, then only the pass/fail conclusions are written,
 *            if 2, then the numerical results are shown. */
