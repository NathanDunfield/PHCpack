Tue 3 Nov 2020 : new dbl_monomials_kernels.h and .cu defines the evaluation
  and differentiation of one product of variables at power series.
  In dbl_monomials_host.cpp, ignored the power series coefficients.
  
Mon 2 Nov 2020 : new test_dbl_monomials.cpp to define the setup for the
  evaluation and differentiation of a monomial.  Added dbl_monomials_host.h
  and dbl_monomials_host.cpp with code to evaluate and differentiate one
  product of variables at power series.  To dbl_monomials_host, added
  special cases and the multiplication with the coefficient series.

Fri 30 Oct 2020 : bugs fixed in test_dbl8_convolutions.cpp to ensure that
  the code for the host is correct.  Fixed dbl8_convolutions_kernels.cu
  and made one more correction to test_dbl8_convolutions.cpp.
  Defined code on the host for the convolution of vectors with deca doubles
  in dbl10_convolutions_host.{h,cpp} and test_dbl10_convolutions.cpp.
  Updated the makefiles.
  Edited dbl5_convolutions_host.h and dbl5_convolutions_kernels.h.
  Added dbl10_convolutions_kernels.h and dbl10_convolutions_kernels.cu,
  tested by test_dbl10_convolutions.cpp.

Thu 29 Oct 2020 : to test_dbl3_convolutions.cpp, added missing initialization
  and a test on gpu_cmplx3_product; edited dbl3_convolutions_kernels.h.
  Added code to compute convolutions in penta double precision,
  in dbl5_convolutions_{host,kernels}.h, dbl5_convolutions_host.cpp,
  dbl5_convolutions_kernels.cu, tested by test_dbl5_convolutions.cpp.
  Updated makefiles.
  Edited dbl4_convolutions_host.h and dbl4_convolutions_kernels.h.
  Added code to compute convolutions in octo double precision,
  in dbl8_convolutions_{host,kernels}.h, dbl8_convolutions_host.cpp,
  dbl8_convolutions_kernels.cu, tested by test_dbl8_convolutions.cpp.
  Updated makefiles.

Wed 28 Oct 2020 : added dbl_convolution_kernels.h and .cu to define kernels
  to compute products of truncated power series, tested by
  test_dbl_convolutions.cpp, updated makefile_unix.
  To test_dbl_convolution_kernels, added functions for complex vectors and
  extended the tests in test_dbl_convolutions.cpp.
  Edited dbl_convolutions_kernels.h, added kernels for double doubles in
  dbl2_convolutions_kernels.h and dbl2_convolutions_kernels.cu, tested
  in test_dbl2_convolutions.cpp; updated makefiles.
  Edited dbl2_convolutions_kernels.h and dbl2_convolutions_kernels.cu.
  Added synchronization to dbl_convolutions_kernels.cu and
  dbl2_convolutions_kernels.cu.  For triple and quad double precision,
  added kernels in {dbl3,dbl4}_convolutions_kernels and {dbl3,dbl4}_
  convolution_kernels.cu, tested by test_{dbl3,dbl4}_convolutions.cpp.
  Updated makefiles.

Mon 26 Oct 2020 : added {dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions_host.{h,cpp} with a
  basic test in test_{dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions.cpp.  Defined makefiles.
  Instead of double x[deg+1] used double *x = new double[deg+1] as
  required for the microsoft windows compiler.  Defined makefile_windows.
  Fixed bugs in {dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions_host.cpp and added better
  tests in test_{dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions.cpp.  Updated makefile_unix.
  Added code for quad double convolutions in dbl4_convolutions_host,
  tested by test_dbl4_convolutions.  Updated makefiles.
