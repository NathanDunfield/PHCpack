Thu 29 Oct 2020 : to test_dbl3_convolutions.cpp, added missing initialization
  and a test on gpu_cmplx3_product; edited dbl3_convolutions_kernels.h.

Wed 28 Oct 2020 : added dbl_convolution_kernels.h and .cu to define kernels
  to compute products of truncated power series, tested by
  test_dbl_convolutions.cpp, updated makefile_unix.
  To test_dbl_convolution_kernels, added functions for complex vectors and
  extended the tests in test_dbl_convolutions.cpp.
  Edited dbl_convolutions_kernels.h, added kernels for double doubles in
  dbl2_convolutions_kernels.h and dbl2_convolutions_kernels.cu, tested
  in test_dbl2_convolutions.cpp; updated makefiles.
  Edited dbl2_convolutions_kernels.h and dbl2_convolutions_kernels.cu.
  Added synchronization to dbl_convolutions_kernels.cu and
  dbl2_convolutions_kernels.cu.  For triple and quad double precision,
  added kernels in {dbl3,dbl4}_convolutions_kernels and {dbl3,dbl4}_
  convolution_kernels.cu, tested by test_{dbl3,dbl4}_convolutions.cpp.
  Updated makefiles.

Mon 26 Oct 2020 : added {dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions_host.{h,cpp} with a
  basic test in test_{dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions.cpp.  Defined makefiles.
  Instead of double x[deg+1] used double *x = new double[deg+1] as
  required for the microsoft windows compiler.  Defined makefile_windows.
  Fixed bugs in {dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions_host.cpp and added better
  tests in test_{dbl,dbl2,dbl3}_convolutions.cpp.  Updated makefile_unix.
  Added code for quad double convolutions in dbl4_convolutions_host,
  tested by test_dbl4_convolutions.  Updated makefiles.
